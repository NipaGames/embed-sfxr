# Embed SFXR
SFXR is a pretty handy sound effect generator originally made by Tomas Pettersson.
GitHub link for SFXR: https://github.com/grimfang4/sfxr

So this my version of SFXR built into a library!
All nonsense, like the GUI and wav-exporting is gone!
Including C# wrapper as well for all Unity users (including me)

Make sure to build with SDL, put all includes into include/SDL2/ and all lib files to lib/-folder.
SDL2 DLL is already in bin/.
If you set up SDL correctly, you can just use my glorious batch files (assuming you are on Windows)
